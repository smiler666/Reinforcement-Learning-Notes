## Value iteration and Policy iteration

Here is a specific example to code value iteration and policy iteration

![](/example1.jpg)

MDP‘s five tuple is：

- states：1、2
- actions：the red line is action 'a' and the blue line is action 'b' in the picture
- rewards：R(1) = 0，R(2) = 1
- p：marked in the figure
- discount factor：0.9

Please go to my blog to read the detail of value iteration and policy iteration 

Welcome criticism and correction

see the code in value iteration.py and policy iteration.py
